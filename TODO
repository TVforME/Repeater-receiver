1. Look at making Go bindings for TSduck library for use directly without using exec and monitoring cmd line output stdio and stderr.
2. Build tcz for tsduck and its dependencies to load at startup.
✔️ 3. Transition dvb.sh to dvb.so using GO configure as deamon and restart if crashed.
4. Impleament mem_monitor.sh to monitor RAM and reboot at XX:XX once the average RAM is reached X%.  Manage memory leaks over loooonnnngggg operating periods. Months to years.
5. Look at adding lspci to piCore busybox. 
6. Look at adding lsdvb to piCore busybox. TSduck has tslsdvb which lists adpaters.
7. Move Linux build to PiCore build.
